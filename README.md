</p>


### Goal

This is ReactJS CRUD application. I coded this project to practice on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS
in a real project. The aim is to learn the responsive behaviour on various devices.



### Installation

Here are the guidelines to run this project on your localhost (you should install node.js on your machine):

1. Clone (Download) this repo on your machine
2. Open terminal in repo directory
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start this project on localhost
 incase `npm start` does not work try `sudo rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install` then `npm start`



> You maybe asked to run this app in another port instead of port 3000, because there is already a process running on this port. Confirm this by hitting `y` key from keyboard.

### Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- ReactJS

> This application is fully responsive
